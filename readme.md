Nite Flights is an isomorphic static site generator powered by Node and React. Its goal is to make it easy to make a "digital scrapbook" out of various media you have, from photos to Tweets. It's pretty far from this overall goal, but malleable enough that you can still build a pretty cool site with it.

Instead of traditional template-based static site generators like Jekyll, nite-flights sites are built with React components, which allow you to easily build full-featured sites, instead of being limited to various plugins and template filters. These components are rendered by the Nite Flights build tool, creating static pages, as well as a bundle of client-side JS that will take over after the initial page render. This allows you to build powerful single-page user-experiences while retaining the advantages of server-rendered applications (such as fast load times and SEO).

For an example site built with this tool, see [the source for loudplaces.disco.zone](https://github.com/thomasboyt/loudplaces.disco.zone).

## Installation

```
npm install -g nite-flights
```

## CLI Usage

### `nite-flights new <path>`

Generate a new blog at `<path>`.

### `nite-flights build [--optimize]`

Build your blog to `_site/`. Optionally minify your client-side app bundle by passing `--optimize`.

### `nite-flights serve`

Serve your site at `localhost:3000`. This will automatically rebuild your client-side bundle and rendered pages when you change files in your project.

## Developing Your Site

*(this whole section is obviously a to-do at the moment. The [source for loudplaces.disco.zone](https://github.com/thomasboyt/loudplaces.disco.zone) may be a useful resource if you want to experiment with Nite Flights)*

## Using Media

While you can use any form of media you want in your client-side application, Nite Flights has special tools for caching and hosting certain media. For example, Tweets can be cached and saved as part of your blog's data, which allows you to render them how you want on the client and server without any dependency on Twitter's JavaScript APIs.
