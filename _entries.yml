    Went to this on a whim because I live near the venue, and it was pretty good. My ears generally can't take hours of metal-volume music (really need to invest in some ear plugs), so the most memorable part of this show ended up being when I ducked out to the bar and ate some brussels sprouts during the second opener.

    I know it might sound lame to have the most memorable moment of a concert being brussels sprouts, but y'all, they were *super good*.

  description: '*Loud.* I heard about this band last week, and picked up their record this morning to get entry to this show. They played their new record in its entirety, and it was awesome. Somewhat low-key crowd, being an early show on a weeknight, but the band was as loud as I could stand in such a small room. Also bought a T-shirt from their bass player after the show.'

  description: "Great set. All new material, which surprised me, given his new special was only a month ago - can't imagine writing a whole new hour in that time. He was still workshopping some of it, and very self-depricating about it (apologizing for a hilarious never-ending bit on reality show ghosts)."

  title: Savages
  location: "Baby's All Right"
  description: "This was such a weird, incredible show, and maybe the best I've ever been to. It was weird, given that Savages went on at *1:15am* on a weeknight, as their show getting rescheduled due to a blizzard. It was even weirder for me because I was just regaining my hearing from seeing Viet Cong earlier, and now I was standing front-and-center for one of my favorite current bands. \n\nI was in the literal front row of a GA audience for, I think, the first time ever, and it made Savages seem ever-so-larger-than-life. Staring straight up into their frontwoman's face as she screamed over my head is an experience I'll never forget. I get goosebumps thinking about it now."

  title: Viet Cong
  location: Mercury Lounge
  description: "I was happy to finally see these guys play, having listened to their singles on repeat for the last two months. When their album dropped, I wasn't that impressed with it, but having heard it live, I actually liked it a lot more. It's interesting how the more raw rock/pop aspects of their music come into play when they're not hiding it behind the traditional post-rock lo-fi studio mixing. Really excited to see them again next time they're here."

  title: Patton Oswalt
  location: Carnegie Hall
  description: "Patton! Wow. Probably the first comedian I ever really loved. I've listened to his specials so many times that I know a lot of his bits by heart. I actually got a *front row seat*, too, thanks to catching the Twitter presale right on time. \n\nThis was a great show, a mix of stuff from his last special (which I think worked a lot better here, with a little more practice) and a lot of new jokes. In the encore, he ended up taking requests, and ended up doing some of my favorite bits. I also got to stand up and shake the dude's hand at the end, which was awesome. \n\nAlso, Carnegie Hall is beautiful and I should try to go to more shows there."

  title: TNA Impact Wrestling taping
  location: Manhattan Center (Hammerstein Ballroom)
  description: "Yeah, so, wrestling! It was $20. Don't hate. We all have our stupid hobbies. \n\nThe most ridiculous part of this - and there were many ridiculous parts, because *wrestling* - was that when I took my initial seat, I posted a picture of it on a forum saying that it was what was available for $20. Turns out, there was a guy sitting behind me who also posted on this forum, and saw my post, and so we ended up hanging out for the whole show! He knew a lot more about the TNA roster than I did, so that worked out well for me. We also ended up getting moved to really good seats that were probably $50-60 online. Thank god TNA is such an unpopular promotion. \n\nI legitimately enjoyed this. Like, I unironically love wrestling, the big dumb spectacle it is, but TNA is *bad* wrestling, at least on TV. In person, though, it's a lot easier to just laugh at the bad booking (aka \"writing\") and appreciate the in-ring action. There were lots of impressive performances by wrestlers I hadn't seen before (Low Ki, Kurt Angle, the Hardys), and I ended up marking out for things that I would probably make fun of if I saw them on TV."

  description: "WOOOOOW what a show this was. I think the bill mostly speaks for itself; I'm not sure I'll ever see a better lineup in one night. The place went insane when TNGHT dropped Blood on the Leaves, as it had *just* come out. \n\nDisclosure was great, and had both Sam Smith (pre-fame) and Jesse Ware. I ended up hanging out with a group of very high dudes for a while, and harmonized on Latch at the end of the show with them :3"

  title: 4Knots Music Festival
  location: South St Seaport
  description: "This was a weird outdoor festival at a seaport. I spent the better part of a day there, since White Lung went on at 3 and The Men went on at 7, and those were the two bands I was mostly interested in seeing. My roommate at the time showed up, and I randomly ran into my friend from Hacker School, so it was a good time. \n\nWhite Lung was awesome to see, but the crowd was totally dead, since no one wants to mosh in 90 degree weather at 3 in the afternoon. Still, I was excited just to get to say I'd seen them live, since they were only playing in 21-and-over venues and I was still underage. \n\nI don't really remember the rest of the sets too much. I remember being kind of bored with Kurt Vile, and while I liked The Men's big singles, I wasn't impressed with their quieter stuff. I still sort of feel that way, though if it catches me in the right mood, I can really appreciate their ballads."

  description: "I don't remember a lot about this show. I went because some Hacker School friends were going, but I'm not really a huge Anamanagchi fan - I like the whole chiptune thing, but they just don't do it for me. However, I do remember liking their show a lot because it just became a whirring blur of poppy synths at some point, and that was very easy to dance to. I also remember one of the openers having some of the weirdest projected visuals ever, freaky GIFs and strange YouTubes. Interesting night."

I hadn't really listened to their second album much by the time I saw this show, but walked away liking it a lot more than I did the first time I listened to it. Also, Bohemean Rhapsody was cool. \n\nYBR was a cool surprise; I still listen to their album on Spotify occasionally."

I went with several cool people from Hacker School, some of whom I still hang out with today!'

I wish NYC had venues like that - Terminal 5 is sorta close, but their balcony isn't nearly as awesome. \n\n(update: after I originally wrote this entry, I went to my first show at Webster Hall, which is similarly pretty, but not nearly as awesome in general)"
